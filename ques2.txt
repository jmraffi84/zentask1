BLOG ON OBJECTS AND ITS INTERNAL REPRESENTATION
-----------------------------------------------
 : object are stand alone, with properties.

Creating Objects in JavaScript:
By object literal
By creating instance of Object directly (using new keyword)
 Consider a person as an object:
 He will have a
 1. Name
 2. Height
 3. Weight
 4. Eye color
 5. Unqine Finger perint and so on.

 In javascript everything is a object and will have a internal representing.

 To call his indiviguality breakup 
 we call as person.name or Person["Name"]
 The more accurant way to call a object closed bracket is recommended.
 In Some cases .notation will have error.



 Object are Key value pairs.

 class obj{
     
     obj1(){
            key      Value 
        //person1 : lucifer
        console.log('This is obj1')
     }
     obj2(){
        key    Value 
        //2 : manifest
         console.log('This is obj1')
     }

 }
    
     
 

So above both has its own key value pair. 

creating a instance of an object: 

    var objNew = new obj()
    if we console.log(objNew)
    
    result will be : obj1 & obj2

    if we console(objNew.obj1)// dot notation
        we will get result as This is obj1
